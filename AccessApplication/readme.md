This project should had been SQL-Server but internal developers still don't have read capabilities.

**Focus** is on selection of a container to use for a specific task, in this case choices in a drop-down for windows forms but the same holds true for web applications.

**Choices**

- DataTable, way too much for this task (shown)
- List&lt;T> which is good (shown)
- Array is even better, requires more work (not shown)
- Immutable collection is best (not shown but there are samples in this solution)
